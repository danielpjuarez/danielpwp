	<h2>My Content Strategy</h2>
	<p>My strategy is simple. I will be showing a one-page document with links to additional resources about me. There
		will be five total sections.
		<br>
		Section 1 will be, essentially, an index of the rest of the page with clickable links to the other sections.
		Each section will have a button that the user can click on to get back to the top, so the whole website flows
		together. It will also feature an eye-catching image that fits the theme of the rest of the page. I will also
		put my name and picture here
		<br>
		Section 2 will be the "about me" section where I write a short blurb about who I am and what my experience
		comes from. The purpose of this section is to draw my potential future employers in and make them understand
		who I am and what I can contribute to their organization. I will emphasize how I work well in a team , and
		possibly even provide links to other team members PWPs.
		<br>
		Section 3 is a small gallery of my work. There will be screenshots that potential employers can look (and
		expand) as well as a link to either the GitHub repository or the place where I deployed the website so they can
		continue to peruse my work if it draws them in.
		<br>
		The 4th/5th sections will be a simple "contact me" form where the interested employers can message me to
		ask for additional information as well as a large list of links to my various forms of online presence
		(LinkedIn, GitHub, my website, etc.). I haven't decided how I big or featured I want these links, or even if I
		want them above or below my contact form, so I've included two variations of my wireframes below.
