## Milestone 1 Feedback
- submitted on time
- covered the required topics, Purpose, Audience, Goal, and Persona
- correct directory structure
- The \<!DOCTYPE html> tag is missing from the start of the HTML file.

Good job so far.

Milestone 1 Grade Tier 3


## Milestone 2a Feedback
* You have your .idea in your git repo.  Your git history makes it clear you know this is wrong, but you should fix it.  This means you probably copy-pasted your .gitignore from elsewhere, and left whitespace on the beginning of the line.  You should fix this and remove .idea from your repo.
* Your commits should be smaller and more bite-sized.  Aside from idea, there's only two commits here.
* You may want to consider a footer for your site.
* Your text is well-written and thorough, but could use a bit of formatting.
* Your wireframes are very good and clearly laid out.
* You may want to consider dropping the menu.  Often you don't need one on a single-page site.

Overall, this is very good work.  Your wireframes set you up very well for the rest of this project, and your text shows some clear thought put into what you are looking for.  You are missing a few small things in your git history and formatting, but the critical pieces of this are all in place. 

This milestone grades at a Tier III.

## Milestone 3 Feedback
* When turning phone to landscape mode, the "My Work" section of your PWP becomes a little cluttered. You might want to adjust your breakpoints or implement a media query so that these items stack similar to how they lookin in portrait mode.
* I suggested in person that you might want to adjust where your page lands when one of the links is clicked on your navbar
* Contact form works
