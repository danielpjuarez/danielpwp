			Target Audience Persona
		</h1>
			<p>
				Bryan Reynolds is a 45 year-old web development manager at a medium to
				large-sized company. His company uses older, but still functional IDEs
				and is focused on fantastic UX for their web apps. Bryan knows exactly
				what he wants out of his employees, but allows them to work fairly
				independently. He doesn't have a lot of time to look at applicants'
				websites so he is looking for someone with good attention to detail and
				a good sense of design and flow, as well as quick access to relevant
				information, such as resumes and other work. Bryan wants someone who
				is passionate about developing high quality web applications because they
				see the potential that they have.
